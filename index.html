        <p id="opening-text">The holistic idea of wellness relates to a person's general well-being. It covers
            emotional, mental, and physical wellness. Living a happy and fulfilled life requires maintaining both
            physical and mental health. Your ability to deal with life's stresses, fortify your relationships with
            people around you, and realise your dreams can all be aided by having a healthy mind and body. You may lower
            your chance of developing chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes by controlling your blood
            pressure and adopting good decisions like eating a balanced diet, getting enough sleep, and exercising
            frequently. Making time for your well-being should be a top priority because it is one of the most important
            things you can do for yourself.</p>
